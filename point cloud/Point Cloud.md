point cloud is close to raw data collected from sensors such as lidar and depth sensor, which indicates using point cloud as data format is a easier way to realize end to end learning process.

# Point cloud
## permutation invariance
point cloud consists of a set of unordered points

## transformation invariance
Rotation and translation of point cloud should not alter classification result.

### Sparsity

### granularity 颗粒度
global feature or local feature?
size of voxels/pillars?
